# Herooes twitter chat clone

This project is for a Twitter clone Progressive Web App (PWA) that allows users to select a character and post messages as that character. The app includes a character selection screen, a message list, and a modal for posting new messages. The HTML code includes references to external libraries for fonts and icons, as well as the app's own CSS and JavaScript files.

The app's UI includes a header with a title, a "new message" button, and a "log out" button. The character selection screen displays images of different characters that the user can choose to represent themselves. The message list displays messages that have been posted, including the avatar of the user who posted the message, their username, and the message text. The modal for posting new messages includes input fields for text, as well as icons for adding location and photos to the message.

The JavaScript code for the app likely handles user interactions such as selecting a character, posting a message, and displaying the message list. It may also incorporate service workers for offline functionality and other PWA features.
